curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in for the group change to take effect
```

---

## Web-Based Installer (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Quest Planner is using the web-based installer, similar to phpBB or WordPress.

### Download Release Package

Download the latest **web-installer** package from the [Releases page](https://github.com/nenadjokic/dndplanning/releases):

```
quest-planner-vX.X.X-web-installer.zip
```

### Installation Steps

1. **Extract the ZIP** to your web server directory:

   ```bash
   unzip quest-planner-vX.X.X-web-installer.zip
   cd quest-planner-vX.X.X-web-installer
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000/install
   ```

5. **Complete the installation wizard:**
   - Create an admin account (username and password)
   - Configure application settings
   - The installer will automatically:
     - Create the SQLite database with all tables
     - Set up your admin user
     - Generate a `.env` configuration file
     - Create an installation lock file

6. **Restart the server** after installation:

   ```bash
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
   npm start
   ```

7. **Login** at `http://localhost:3000/login` with your admin credentials!

### Security Note

After installation, the installer is automatically locked via `data/installed.lock`. To reinstall, delete this file and restart the server.

For extra security on production servers, you can optionally delete `routes/install.js`.

---

## Server Installation (Manual)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/nenadjokic/dndplanning.git
cd dndplanning
```

Or manually copy the files to your desired directory (e.g. `/opt/dndplanning`).

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install --production
```

The `--production` flag skips dev dependencies (nodemon) which aren't needed in production.

### 3. Configuration

Create a `.env` file from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set the values:

```env
PORT=3000
SESSION_SECRET=put-a-long-random-string-here
```

To generate a secure session secret:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"
```

Copy the output and set it as `SESSION_SECRET`.

### 4. Start the App

**Development** (with auto-reload):

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Production**:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port you set in `.env`).

### 5. Process Manager (Production)

For production environments, use **PM2** to run the app as a service with automatic restarts:

```bash
# Install PM2
sudo npm install -g pm2

# Start the app
cd /opt/dndplanning
pm2 start server.js --name quest-planner

# Enable auto-start on boot
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

Useful PM2 commands:

```bash
pm2 status              # Status of all processes
pm2 logs quest-planner  # Real-time logs
pm2 restart quest-planner
pm2 stop quest-planner
```

### 6. Reverse Proxy (Nginx)

To make the app available on port 80/443 (with or without a domain), set up Nginx as a reverse proxy.

Install Nginx:

```bash
sudo apt install -y nginx
```

Create the config file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/quest-planner`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name quest.example.com;  # or your IP address

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Enable the site and restart Nginx:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/quest-planner /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

For HTTPS with Let's Encrypt:

```bash
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d quest.example.com
```

---

## Docker Installation

### 1. Docker Build and Run

Clone the repository and enter the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nenadjokic/dndplanning.git
cd dndplanning
```

Then build and run:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t quest-planner .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name quest-planner \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 48) \
  -v quest-planner-data:/app/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  quest-planner
```

Parameter reference:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `-d` | Run the container in the background (detached) |
| `--name quest-planner` | Container name for easier management |
| `-p 3000:3000` | Map host port 3000 to container port 3000 |
| `-e SESSION_SECRET=...` | Set the session secret as an environment variable |
| `-v quest-planner-data:/app/data` | Persistent volume for the SQLite database |
| `--restart unless-stopped` | Auto-restart on boot and crash |

Useful Docker commands:

```bash
docker logs quest-planner          # View logs
docker logs -f quest-planner       # Real-time logs
docker stop quest-planner          # Stop
docker start quest-planner         # Start again
docker restart quest-planner       # Restart
docker rm -f quest-planner         # Remove container (data persists in volume)
```

### 2. Docker Compose

A simpler way to manage the container. Uses the `docker-compose.yml` included in the project:

```bash
# Clone repo (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/nenadjokic/dndplanning.git
cd dndplanning

# Start (build + run)
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop
docker compose down

# Rebuild after code changes
docker compose up -d --build
```

The `docker-compose.yml` automatically:
- Builds the image from the Dockerfile
- Maps port 3000
- Creates a persistent volume for the database
- Sets a restart policy
- Loads environment variables from the `.env` file

### 3. Docker on Raspberry Pi

The Docker image works on ARM64 architecture (Raspberry Pi 4/5) without any modifications since it uses the Node.js Alpine image which supports multiple architectures.

```bash
# On Raspberry Pi
cd /opt/dndplanning
docker compose up -d
```

If the Pi is running an older 32-bit OS, change the base image in the `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-bullseye-slim
```

instead of `node:20-alpine`.

#### Local Network Access

If the Pi is at `192.168.1.100`, the app is available at:

```
http://192.168.1.100:3000
```

For access with a custom domain, add to `/etc/hosts` on the client machine:

```
192.168.1.100  quest.local
```

## Database Backup

Quest Planner has a built-in backup system accessible from **Guild Settings**.

### Manual Backup & Restore (via UI)

1. Go to **Guild Settings** (admin only)
2. Scroll to **Database Backup & Restore**
3. Click **Download Backup** to download the current database
4. To restore, click **Restore from File** and upload a previous `.db` backup
5. The server automatically creates a safety backup before restoring and restarts after

### Google Drive Auto-Backup

Automatic daily backups to Google Drive can be configured in Guild Settings. Requires Google Login to be configured first (same OAuth credentials).

1. Configure **Google Login** in Guild Settings (if not already done)
2. Enable the **Google Drive API** in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) → APIs & Services → Library
3. Add `https://your-domain.com/admin/backup/gdrive/callback` as an **Authorized redirect URI** in your OAuth client
4. In Guild Settings → Google Drive Auto-Backup, click **Authorize Google Drive**
5. Optionally enter a folder ID to organize backups
6. Enable auto-backup — runs daily at 3:00 AM, keeps last 7 backups on Drive

### Manual Backup (CLI)

```bash
# Without Docker
cp /opt/dndplanning/data/dndplanning.db /backup/dndplanning-$(date +%Y%m%d).db

# With Docker
docker cp quest-planner:/app/data/dndplanning.db ./backup-dndplanning.db
```

---

## Updating

### With Docker (recommended)

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Without Docker

```bash
cd /opt/dndplanning
git pull
npm install --production
pm2 restart quest-planner
```

The admin can also check for updates from the **Guild Settings** page using the "Check for Updates" button.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Docker: "permission denied" or "readonly database" errors

**Symptoms:**
- App crashes in a restart loop after updating
- Logs show: `EACCES: permission denied, open '/app/data/installed.lock'`
- Logs show: `SqliteError: attempt to write a readonly database`

**Cause:** Docker volume permissions issue. The volume is owned by root but the container runs as user `node` (UID 1000).

**Solution:**

```bash
# Stop the container
docker compose down

# Fix volume permissions
sudo chmod -R 777 $(docker volume inspect <volume-name> -f '{{.Mountpoint}}')

# For Quest Planner, the volume is usually named:
# dndplanning_quest-planner-data or quest-planner-data

# Example:
sudo chmod -R 777 $(docker volume inspect dndplanning_quest-planner-data -f '{{.Mountpoint}}')

# Restart
docker compose up -d
```

**Alternative:** Run container as root (add to `docker-compose.yml`):

```yaml
services:
  app:
    user: "0:0"  # Run as root
    # ... rest of config
```

**Note:** After v2.0.2, the app will detect this situation and continue running even without write permissions to the lock file.

### Installer Appears on Existing Installation

**Symptoms:**
- After updating, you see the installation wizard instead of your app
- You already have data and users in the database

**Cause:** The `data/installed.lock` file is missing.

**Solution:**

```bash
# Docker:
docker exec quest-planner sh -c "echo '$(date)' > /app/data/installed.lock"
docker restart quest-planner

# Without Docker:
echo "$(date)" > data/installed.lock
pm2 restart quest-planner
```

**Note:** After v2.0.1, the app automatically detects existing databases and won't show the installer.

### CSRF Token Errors Behind Reverse Proxy

**Symptoms:**
- "Invalid CSRF token" errors when submitting forms
- Session keeps logging out

**Cause:** Missing proxy configuration.

**Solution:** Add to your `.env` file:

```env
TRUST_PROXY=true
SECURE_COOKIES=true  # Only if using HTTPS
```

Then restart the server.

- Fixed birthday banner persisting past midnight due to UTC vs local time comparison

### v0.9.15 (2026-02-01)

- **Faster dice history fade** — dice roll history now fades out over 60 seconds instead of 5 minutes; rolls disappear quickly to keep the screen clean, especially on mobile

### v0.9.14 (2026-02-01)

- **Fix: Active players avatar** — avatar images in the footer were missing the `/avatars/` path prefix, showing a broken image icon instead of the user's avatar

### v0.9.13 (2026-02-01)

- **Dice rolling sound** — procedural dice-on-wood sound effect plays when rolling dice; generated via Web Audio API with filtered noise bursts and low wood resonance, no external audio files needed

### v0.9.12 (2026-02-01)

- **Active Players footer** — real-time footer bar showing who's currently online with avatars, usernames, and activity duration; players marked "away" after 1 minute of inactivity (dimmed); removed after 5 minutes

- **Presence heartbeat API** — new `POST /api/dice/presence/heartbeat` endpoint for presence tracking and dice change detection

### v0.9.11 (2026-02-01)

- **Inactivity fade** — Dice roll history gradually fades out over 5 minutes of inactivity; rolls disappear completely when idle and reappear bright when someone rolls again
- **Fix: iPhone home gesture** — Replaced mobile bottom drawer with a narrower right sidebar; no more accidental app exits on iPhone when interacting with the history strip

### v0.9.10 (2026-02-01)

- **Fix: History order** — Dice roll history now correctly shows oldest at top (faded) and newest at bottom (bright); oldest rolls fade out and disappear naturally

### v0.9.9 (2026-02-01)

- **Dice Roll History** — global sidebar showing the last 10 dice rolls from all users in real-time; newest rolls appear at the bottom with an opacity gradient (oldest fades out)
- **History API** — new `POST /api/dice/roll` and `GET /api/dice/history` endpoints for saving and retrieving dice rolls
- **Desktop sidebar** — thin fixed right sidebar (200px) with non-blocking pointer-events; rolls displayed with username, description, and result
- **Mobile bottom drawer** — collapsible bottom strip on portrait screens; tap the grab handle to expand and see full history
- **Auto-polling** — history refreshes every 10 seconds and immediately after each roll

### v0.9.8 (2026-02-01)

- **Center drop spawn** — Dice now spawn above the center of the screen and drop down with random scatter, always fully visible on any device
- **Staggered horizontal layout** — Multiple dice spread evenly along the X axis above center before dropping

### v0.9.7 (2026-02-01)

- **Per-die frustum bounds** — Visible area is now computed at each die's actual spawn height, not at ground level; fixes dice appearing outside the screen on all devices
- **Lower spawn height** — Dice spawn at y=0.5 (near ground) instead of y=1.5, keeping them well within the visible frustum
- **Larger margin** — Increased edge margin from 1.2 to 1.5 units so entire dice are visible including edges

### v0.9.6 (2026-02-01)

- **Camera-aware spawn** — Dice spawn positions are calculated from actual visible screen bounds (camera FOV + aspect ratio), so they're always fully visible on any device and orientation
- **Top-right corner to center** — Dice spawn in the visible top-right corner and travel diagonally toward the center of the screen
- **Responsive walls** — Invisible physics walls now match the visible screen edges, adapting to portrait/landscape
- **Adaptive grid** — Grid columns and spacing auto-adjust to the available screen width; narrow portrait phones use fewer columns

### v1.0.12 (2026-02-06)

**Changes:**
- Removed automatic web-based update feature — admin panel now shows manual update instructions (`git pull && docker compose up -d --build`) when a new version is available

### v1.0.11 (2026-02-06)

- **Improved Race Display** — Races include size and speed info, clean descriptions without technical tags, and properly formatted racial traits with recursive nested object parsing
- **5e.tools Tag Parsing** — Automatic cleaning of internal 5e.tools format tags ({@item}, {@spell}, {@variantrule}, {@sense}, etc.) into readable text
- **Terminology Update** — Changed "Species" to "Races" throughout the Vault UI to match traditional D&D terminology

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed skill selection display showing empty list after "Choose 2 from"

- Fixed equipment and proficiency parsing to handle complex 5e.tools data structures

### v0.9.5 (2026-02-01)

- **Staggered dice spawning** — Dice spawn in a grid pattern with 1.5-unit spacing so they never overlap, even D100 pairs
- **50% canvas travel** — Dice now travel at least half the play area from top-left toward center before settling
- **Proper dice-dice collisions** — Reduced ground friction (0.5) and increased dice-dice restitution (0.35) for natural bouncing interactions

### v0.9.4 (2026-02-01)

- **Top-left corner spawn** — Dice now spawn from the top-left corner and travel toward the center of the screen
- **Elongated D10 shape** — D10 now has proper pentagonal trapezohedron proportions with taller poles and narrower ring for a realistic shape
- **D100 as two D10 dice** — Rolling D100 now throws two physical D10 dice: one with 00-90 (tens) and one with 0-9 (units), combined for the final result
- **Faster physics** — Stronger gravity (-80), higher damping (0.4), and aggressive sleep detection for quicker settling

### v0.9.3 (2026-02-01)

- **Dice edge outlines** — Thin dark brown lines on all die edges highlight the shape and dimensions of each die face

### v0.9.2 (2026-02-01)

- **Fast dice animation** — Entire roll animation completes within 1 second max; dice settle quickly with strong gravity (-50) and high damping (0.3)
- **Top-right corner throw** — Dice now fall from the top-right corner and travel toward the center of the page with a natural arc
- **2-second display** — After dice stop, they remain visible for 2 seconds before cleanup
- **Dice-dice collisions** — Multiple dice properly bump off each other during the throw

### v0.9.1 (2026-02-01)

- **Automatic cache busting** — All CSS and JS asset URLs now include a `?v=` query string tied to the app version; when the app updates, browsers automatically fetch fresh files on the next page load
- **Network-first service worker** — Service worker fetch strategy changed from cache-first to network-first for assets; fresh content is always served when online, cached copies used only when offline
- **Service worker no-cache headers** — `sw.js` is now served with `Cache-Control: no-cache` so the browser always checks for a new version on every page load

### v0.9.0 (2026-02-01)

- **Two-phase animation** — Pure physics simulation runs first with zero quaternion manipulation, allowing natural trajectories with inertia and real bouncing; after all dice sleep, a smooth 400ms visual slerp corrects orientation to the pre-determined result
- **Real dice-dice collisions** — NaiveBroadphase guarantees all-pairs collision detection; dedicated dice-dice contact material (friction 0.4, restitution 0.4) makes dice bounce off each other naturally
- **Balanced D10/D100 shape** — Retuned pentagonal trapezohedron proportions (poles ±0.88r, ring ±0.31r, radius 0.77r) for a balanced shape that's slightly taller than wide
- **Even spawn distribution** — Multiple dice are distributed evenly around a circle based on index, ensuring they converge and collide in the center
- **Lower angular velocity** — Reduced from ±20 to ±12 so individual face transitions are visible during the roll

### v0.8.9 (2026-02-01)

- **Dice-dice collisions** — Multiple dice now physically collide and bounce off each other using SAP broadphase collision detection; no more ghost dice passing through
- **Pre-determined rolls** — Results are computed before the throw; each die starts oriented to show a different number than the final result, then the physics simulation rolls it with a smooth quaternion slerp correction to land on the target face
- **Initial orientation guarantee** — The starting face is always different from the final face, so you see a real transition during every roll

### v0.8.8 (2026-02-01)

- **Results banner at bottom** — Dice roll results now appear at the bottom of the screen instead of the top for better visibility
- **Fix: Dice actually roll across faces** — 120 Hz sub-stepped physics (was 60 Hz single-step) with proper delta-time accumulation eliminates jitter; higher angular velocity (±20) and lower damping (0.02/0.08) ensure dice tumble across many faces before settling
- **Fix: D10/D100 shape** — Taller, pointier proportions (poles at ±1.1r, ring at ±0.28r, radius 0.72r) matching a real pentagonal trapezohedron
- **Higher spawn + stronger throw** — Dice spawn at height 2-3 (was 1-1.5) with throw speed 6-10 (was 5-8) for longer visible arcs

### v0.8.7 (2026-02-01)

- **Realistic dice throwing** — Dice are now thrown laterally from the edge of the play area toward the center with momentum, bouncing off walls and rolling across the surface face-by-face before settling; replaces the old "drop and vibrate" behavior
- **Sleep-based settling** — Uses cannon-es body sleep detection instead of manual velocity thresholds; dice stop cleanly with zero vibration once at rest
- **Random initial orientation** — Each die starts with a random quaternion rotation so the initial face shown is unpredictable
- **Fix: D10/D100 triangle seams** — Rebuilt D10 mesh with shared kite-face normals computed from face diagonals; auto-corrects triangle winding to always face outward; eliminates visible triangle artifacts
- **Stronger gravity** — Increased to -20 for faster ground contact and more natural arc
- **Minimal air damping** — Reduced linear/angular damping to 0.05/0.15; ground friction now does the actual slowing like real physics

### v0.8.6 (2026-02-01)

- **Fix: Dice actually tumble** — Angular velocity increased to ±16 with 0.5 damping; dice now visibly roll across multiple faces before settling instead of vibrating in place
- **Fix: D10/D100 rendering** — Reversed face triangle winding so normals point outward; faces are no longer invisible due to backface culling
- **Bouncier physics** — Restitution increased to 0.35 so dice bounce on impact and roll naturally
- **Higher lateral velocity** — Dice spread across the surface with visible rolling motion

### v0.8.5 (2026-02-01)

- **Slower dice rotation** — Angular velocity reduced from ±10 to ±3 and damping increased to 0.4 for a much more natural, readable roll
- **Shorter display time** — Dice and results banner now stay on screen for 5 seconds instead of 10

### v0.8.4 (2026-02-01)

- **Fix: Dice not visible on desktop** — removed CSS canvas sizing conflict and bumped service worker cache to force fresh file loading on all browsers
- **Fix: Numbers on all dice faces** — converted all polyhedra to non-indexed geometry with proper per-face UV mapping via face-plane projection; numbers now appear centered on every face of D4, D8, D10, D12, and D20
- **Fix: D10 geometry spikes** — adjusted pentagonal trapezohedron vertex proportions for a rounder, more realistic shape
- **Fix: Physics realism** — reduced gravity (-12 vs -30), added linear/angular damping (0.3), increased friction (0.6), lower angular velocity; dice now tumble naturally instead of shaking
- **Fix: Roll duration** — dice settle in ~2 seconds (120 frames max) instead of 6 seconds
- **No overlay background** — removed dark backdrop behind rolling dice for a cleaner look
- **No shadows** — removed shadow rendering entirely for better performance and appearance
- **Smaller face numbers** — font size adapts to digit count (35%/28%/22%) for clean centered display on all die types
- **D4 bottom-face reading** — D4 result is now read from the ground face (standard convention) instead of ambiguous top-face detection
